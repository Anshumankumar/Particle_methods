\section{Introduction}
It was really difficult to implement the Vortex Panel method with each panel method having linear distribution
of vorticity. The difficulty came due to complicated formula of linear Panels which posed a difficulty in creating
the Matrix A for Panel Method. Once linear distribution method was implemented it was really easy to implement method
for constant distribution. The dynamic change in Vortex Distribution led to change in structure of Simulator from continious
to stepwise simulation.

\section{Results}
        The results are shown in the pictures. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first figure give the flow 
        across a circular cylinder using Vortex Panel Method with linear distribution in panel.
    \item The second figure show the trace of vortex at a distance 1.25 unit form cylinder using Vortex Panel Method.
    \item The third picture the vortex at a distance of 1.25 unit but using method of images.
    \item Finally the fourth picture show loglog plot of error between vortex panel method and doublet approach. It obvious red show linear distribution and blue shows the constant distribution.
\end{itemize}
